            <h1>Web-Med</h1>
            <p>Online Medication system, also known as WebMed is there to solve the problem of overcrowding in hospitals.</p>
            <p>This web application will be built with the goal of eliminating the bigger number of people visiting the hospitals.</p>
            <p>With this information the system will be able to detect the disease and subscribe the right treatment for the doctor in charge</p>
            <p>With the signs and symptoms entered, the system is going to detect whether the user needs treatment as soon as possible or not, whether they need to meet the doctor or it will just prescribe medicine for the user to buy at a pharmacy. This will all be done once the doctor in charge approves of the prescribed medicine by the system.</p>
            <h2>More Insight on WebMed</h2>
            <p>This web based application has a patient section where patients will be providing their signs and symptoms by filling a form and the form will be submitted to be processed, once the system has diagnosed the information entered and prescribes the right treatmentand then it sends the result to the doctor for approval. </p><br> 
            <p>It also has a section where we have information about how to take care of your health; fitness, diet information, about how to avoid contracting diseases like malaria e.g. by sleeping in a net, signs and symptoms of various diseases etc.</p>
            <p>If the condition of the patient seem to be worse based on signs and symptoms provided by the patient to the system then system notifies a patient to meet the doctor immediately</p>
